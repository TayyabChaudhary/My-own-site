               <p className="has-text-weight-bold">In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project,
                which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born.
                 Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.
                 [2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser.
                  At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally
                   text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds.
                    The Mosaic browser broke this mould.
                    A website or web site is a collection of related network web resources, such as web pages, multimedia content, which are typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.</p>
